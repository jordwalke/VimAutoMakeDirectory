VimAutoMakeDirectory
====================

Asks to create directories in Vim when needed

Have you ever typed the path of a file in Vim, only to find that the leading directories have not yet been created? This plugin will let you know that the directories do not yet exist and it will ask you if you'd like to create them.

From https://github.com/thoughtstream/Damian-Conway-s-Vim-Setup/blob/master/.vimrc

This is a repo that only includes that one configuration so that it can be managed by `Vundle`/`NeoBundle` etc.
